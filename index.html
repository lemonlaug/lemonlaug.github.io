	<h2>Our life</h2>
	<p>Ximena and Isaac lived 4 blocks away from one another but used the internet to expedite their otherwise inevitable meeting. Isaac proposed a date at Ximena's corner bar, which though convenient for him, was fortunately more convenient for her. Immeditely smitten, Isaac had to wait months for Ximena to come around, a task requiring both vast patience and strategic use of chance encounters around the neighborhood.</p>
	<p>Ximena and Isaac share interests in music (though not the same kinds), outdoor adventures, and good food, drink and company! They live together in San Francisco, where they have an adopted pooch named Moose.</p>

    <header>Things to Do in Anderson Valley</header>
    <div>
      <p>
	  Anderson Valley is home to some of the region's best wine and beer. Check out <a href="http://www.balovineyards.com/">Balo</a>, our favorite winery in California, for a game of Bocce and a wine tasting on the house. (We insist you try the Pinot Noir. Trust us.) <a href="http://avbc.com">The Anderson Valley Brewing Company</a> is also a great spot for a brewery tour.</p>

<p>Not much for day drinking? No problem! The region is home to some excellent hiking, swimming hole and scenic driving options. Check out <a href="http://parks.ca.govhttp://parks.ca.gov">Hendy Woods</a> for a stroll beneath the redwoods.</p>

<p>Or, simply take it easy and wander the tiny town of Boonville and vacation at a snail's pace and you'll fit right in. Hit up the Redwood Drive-In for an appropriately greasy breakfast with the locals (the fresh donuts are a must), or the Boonville General Store for their latest soup and sandwich. Both are located on the main drag in Boonville, along with some other choice pit stops on your wander. </p>

<p>If you discover anything else, let us know!</p>
