      <h2>What to wear</h2>
      <p>Friday is casual, so wear anything you want or whatever you came from the airport in.</p>
      <p>Saturday, we're going to get dressed up! We hope you'll come wearing your favorite stylish garb. Think semi-formal, with autumn/winter layers.</p>
      <p>Our plan is to do the ceremony and dancing outdoors. Temperatures in Boonville will probably be in the mid 60s during the day and cooler at night. We'll have patio heaters and bonfires, but if you're a <em>friolenta/o</em> come prepared! In the event of rain, we'll move everything indoors!</p>
      <h2>What to Expect in Boonville</h2>
      <p>Boonville is a small town with a nice hotel, a small-time grocery, a hardware store, some restaurants and not much else, so you should probably not plan on buying anything in town. If you've forgotten something, your best bet on the way there is probably Santa Rosa. As an example, once you're in Boonville the nearest Wal Mart is in Ukiah, 35 miles away.</p>
      <h2>How to get to Boonville</h2>
      <p>Navigating to Boonville is easy! Google maps may route you in a slightly different way--which you're welcome to follow and may be significantly faster depending on traffic, but the simplest to follow route is to take the US-101 North all the way to CA-128 West. It should take about 2.5 or 3 hours under good conditions, but with Friday afternoon traffic it could take longer.</p>
      <h3>The simplest directions</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>From SFO follow signs for US-101 N over the Golden Gate and then for an additional 80 miles.</li>
	<li>Take exit for CA-128 <em>West</em> and follow CA-128 W for 30 miles to Boonville.</li> 
      </ul>
      <h3>Equivalent but more detailed directions.</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>From San Francisco Airport follow signs for the US-101 North. This route is a limited-access highway for 6 or so miles until you approach downtown San Francisco. After that signs for US-101 will direct you onto city streets, which you should continue to follow.</li>
	<li>In the city US-101 goes north on Van Ness St.</li>
	<li>Continue following US-101 by making a left on Lombard St.</li>
	<li>US-101 becomes limited access again and takes you over the Golden Gate Bridge</li>
	<li>Stay on US-101 N for 80 miles</li>
	<li>In cloverdale, take the exit for CA-128 W. Note the exit for CA-128 E is about 10 miles before the exit for the west direction, so don't freak out. </li>
	<li>Continue on 128 for 30 miles to Boonville! It's a small town, but 128 is the main street in town, so you can't miss it.</li>
      </ul>

      <div>
	<p>Ximena and Isaac lived 4 blocks away from one another but used the internet to expedite their otherwise inevitable meeting. Isaac proposed a date at Ximena's corner bar, which though convenient for him, was fortunately more convenient for her. Immediately smitten, Isaac had to wait months for Ximena to come around, a task requiring both vast patience and strategic use of chance encounters around the neighborhood.</p>
	<p>Ximena and Isaac share interests in music (though not the same kinds), outdoor adventures, and good food, drink and company! They live together in San Francisco, where they have an adopted pooch named Moose.</p>

    <header>Things to Do in Anderson Valley</header>
    <div>
      <p>
	  Anderson Valley is home to some of the region's best wine and beer. Check out <a href="http://www.balovineyards.com/">Balo</a>, our favorite winery in California, for a game of Bocce and a wine tasting on the house. (We insist you try the Pinot Noir. Trust us.) <a href="http://avbc.com">The Anderson Valley Brewing Company</a> is also a great spot for a brewery tour.</p>

<p>Not much for day drinking? No problem! The region is home to some excellent hiking, swimming hole and scenic driving options. Check out <a href="http://parks.ca.govhttp://parks.ca.gov">Hendy Woods</a> for a stroll beneath the redwoods. Right in town in Boonville is <a href="http://www.pennyroyalfarm.com/">Pennroyal</a> farms, a winery, goat farm and cheese-making operation. Tastings of wine and/or cheese are available, as are farm tours. Call ahead to book farm tours.</p>

<p>Or, simply take it easy and wander the tiny town of Boonville and vacation at a snail's pace and you'll fit right in. Hit up the Redwood Drive-In for an appropriately greasy breakfast with the locals (the fresh donuts are a must), or the Boonville General Store for their latest soup and sandwich. Both are located on the main drag in Boonville, along with some other choice pit stops on your wander. </p>

<p>If you discover anything else, let us know!</p>
