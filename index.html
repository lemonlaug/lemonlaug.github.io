	<h2>Our life</h2>
	<p>Ximena and Isaac lived 4 blocks away from one another but used the internet to expedite their otherwise inevitable meeting. Isaac proposed a date at Ximena's corner bar, which was convenient for him, but was fortunately more convenient for her. Immeditely smitten, Isaac had to wait months for Ximena to come around, a task requiring both vast patience and strategic use of chance encounters around the neighborhood.</p>
	<p>Ximena and Isaac share interests in music (though not the same kinds), outdoor adventures and good food, drink and company! They live together in San Francisco, where they have an adopted mutt named Moose.</p>
